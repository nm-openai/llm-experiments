# LLM Experiments

Just a place for me to test ideas and practice playing around with LLMs. A key goal is to use a combination of my knowledge and modern coding tools to move quickly and implement ideas. I will implement things as close to the metal as possible, but use packages like hf transformers and pytorch to help move faster.

# Tasks
- `01_pretraining` Basic FC NN, RNN, Transformer trained to predict the next token on Shakespeare dataset (use GPUs)
- `02_sft_classification` Pre-trained transformer SFT for classification, test several techniques
- `03_sft_instruction` Pre-trained transformer SFT for instruction following
- `04_rl_math` Pre-trained transformer RL for solving math problems
- `05_diffusion_audio` Basic diffusion model to produce sound
- `06_full_duplex` Full duplex model?
